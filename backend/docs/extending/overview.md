# Extending the Knowledge Table Backend

## Overview

The Knowledge Table backend is designed for extensibility, allowing developers to integrate new capabilities and services with ease. This flexibility enables the system to adapt to evolving requirements and leverage new technologies as they emerge.

## Key Areas for Extension

You can extend the backend in the following areas:

1. **Document Loaders**
   - **Add support for new document formats**: Extend the system to handle additional file types (e.g., PDFs, DOCX, or HTML).
   - **Integrate with different document parsing libraries**: Utilize external libraries or custom logic for document parsing.
   - **Customize document splitting and preprocessing**: Implement strategies for document chunking, metadata extraction, or content filtering.

2. **LLM (Large Language Model) Services**
   - **Integrate with new LLM providers**: Add support for various LLM platforms (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
   - **Implement custom prompting strategies**: Optimize the interaction with LLMs by modifying prompts to suit specific tasks.
   - **Optimize LLM usage for specific use cases**: Create efficient logic to reduce costs and latency while ensuring high-quality responses.

3. **Vector Databases**
   - **Add support for different vector databases**: Introduce support for more vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate).
   - **Implement custom indexing and search strategies**: Create specialized indexing and retrieval mechanisms to improve search performance.
   - **Optimize vector operations for performance**: Fine-tune indexing, storage, and querying of vectors to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.

## Extension Guides

Detailed guides for extending each area are provided in the following documents:

- [Extending Document Loaders](document_loaders.md)
- [Extending LLM Services](llm_services.md)
- [Extending Vector Databases](vector_databases.md)

## General Extension Principles

When developing extensions for the Knowledge Table backend, consider the following best practices:

1. **Modularity**: Design new components as modular, self-contained units that can be easily plugged into the system. Avoid introducing dependencies that could affect other areas.
   
   _Example_: A custom document loader should not interfere with the existing processing pipeline and should adhere to the base class structure.

2. **Consistency**: Follow established design patterns and coding conventions. New features should integrate seamlessly into the architecture, both in terms of code structure and user experience.
   
   _Example_: New LLM integrations should use similar interfaces and configuration approaches as existing models.

3. **Configuration**: Make new components configurable through environment variables or configuration files, rather than hardcoding values. This allows users to customize settings without modifying the code.
   
   _Example_: A new vector database should expose options for the connection string and indexing strategies via configuration files.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with meaningful error messages. Avoid silent failures and provide logs or feedback that can help identify issues.
   
   _Example_: If a document parsing process fails, return an error response with clear details about the failure, such as file format issues.

5. **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for your components. Ensure your tests cover common edge cases and unexpected inputs.
   
   _Example_: Include tests for different document formats if you're building a custom document loader, ensuring that each format is parsed as expected.

6. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for your extension. This should include a high-level overview, usage instructions, and any required configurations or environment setup.
   
   _Example_: Document the steps to enable a custom LLM service, including any API keys or external dependencies.

7. **Performance**: Consider the scalability and performance implications of your new components, especially in high-traffic or data-intensive environments.
   
   _Example_: Optimize vector operations (e.g., batch inserts) to minimize the time and resources required for large datasets.

## Getting Started

To begin extending the Knowledge Table backend:

1. **Familiarize yourself with the codebase**: Review the existing architecture and patterns in the area you're planning to extend (e.g., document loaders, LLM services, vector databases).
   
2. **Identify the area to extend**: Whether it's document loaders, LLM integrations, or vector databases, make sure you understand how these components currently work.

3. **Review the relevant extension guide**: Each area has a dedicated guide with specific instructions for building extensions.

4. **Create a new branch**: Use Git to create a new branch for your extension work, ensuring isolation from the main codebase.

5. **Develop your extension**: Follow the guidelines and established patterns to build your extension. Use existing base classes where available to maintain consistency.

6. **Write tests for your new component**: Implement both unit and integration tests to verify that your extension works as expected.

7. **Update configuration and documentation**: Ensure that any new configuration options are added to the appropriate files, and provide detailed documentation on how to use your extension.

8. **Submit a pull request**: Once your extension is complete, submit a pull request (PR) for review. Be sure to include relevant tests, documentation, and configuration updates.

By following these guidelines, you can contribute meaningful extensions to the Knowledge Table backend, enhancing its functionality and adapting it to new use cases.
