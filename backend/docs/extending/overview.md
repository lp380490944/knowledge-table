# Extending the Knowledge Table Backend

## Overview

The Knowledge Table backend is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to add new capabilities and integrate with various services. This flexibility enables the system to adapt to evolving requirements and leverage new technologies as they become available.

## Key Areas for Extension

The backend can be extended in several key areas:

1. **Document Loaders**
   - Add support for new document formats
   - Integrate with different document parsing libraries
   - Customize document splitting and preprocessing

2. **LLM (Language Model) Services**
   - Integrate with new LLM providers
   - Implement custom prompting strategies
   - Optimize LLM usage for specific use cases

3. **Vector Databases**
   - Add support for different vector database solutions
   - Implement custom indexing and search strategies
   - Optimize vector operations for performance

## Extension Guides

Detailed guides for extending each area are provided in separate documents:

- [Extending Document Loaders](document_loaders.md)
- [Extending LLM Services](llm_services.md)
- [Extending Vector Databases](vector_databases.md)

## General Extension Principles

When extending the Knowledge Table backend, keep the following principles in mind:

1. **Modularity**: New components should be designed as modular, self-contained units that integrate cleanly with the existing architecture.

2. **Consistency**: Follow the established patterns and conventions in the codebase to maintain consistency and readability.

3. **Configuration**: Make new components configurable, allowing users to enable or customize them without code changes.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging to facilitate debugging and maintenance.

5. **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests for new components to ensure reliability and ease of maintenance.

6. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for new components, including usage instructions and any configuration options.

7. **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of new components, especially for operations that may scale with data volume.

## Getting Started

To begin extending the Knowledge Table backend:

1. Familiarize yourself with the existing codebase and architecture.
2. Identify the area you want to extend (document loaders, LLM services, or vector databases).
3. Review the specific extension guide for your chosen area.
4. Create a new branch for your extension work.
5. Implement your extension following the guidelines and existing patterns.
6. Write tests for your new component.
7. Update configuration files and documentation as necessary.
8. Submit a pull request for review.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the extensible architecture of the Knowledge Table backend, you can contribute new features and integrations that enhance the system's capabilities and adapt it to new use cases.
